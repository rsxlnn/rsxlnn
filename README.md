**I do not appreciate it (for the matter, no one does) when you spam my Discord, V3rmillion or Email. It's not funny nor will it ever be funny. Your not a jokester either. Please only send me an email, DM on Discord, or PM on V3rmillion if you have any issues with my code, or something does not work as intended.**

### Raindrop Team

The Raindrop Client, which was created by [@looking4pixel](https://github.com/looking4pixel), is a hack client for Minecraft. The client is free and open-sourced, meaning that anyone can fork it and contribute to it. We have attempted to make this client as near as possible to a private, paid client. You can find the organization [here](https://github.com/raindrop-team).
